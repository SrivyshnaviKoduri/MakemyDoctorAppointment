 	Life is becoming too busy to get medical appointments in 
	person and to maintain a proper health care. The main idea of this
	work is to provide ease and comfort to patients while taking 
	appointment from doctors and it also resolves the problems that
	the patients has to face while making an appointment. The android
	application Mr.Doc acts as a client whereas the database 
	containing the doctor’s details, patient’s details and appointment
	details is maintained by a website that acts as a server.
